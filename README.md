└── types/         # TypeScript definitions
```

**Quality Features:**

## Need Help?

**Common Issues:**
- **"API key error"**: Make sure your `.env.local` file has the correct API key
- **"City not found"**: Try a different spelling or include the country (e.g., "Paris, France")
- **App won't start**: Run `npm install` first

**Want to add features?**
The code is organized to make adding new features easy. Each component is independent and well-tested.
