# Weather App - Interview Study Guide

*A simple guide to confidently explain your weather app project*

---

## Quick Project Summary

**"I built a weather app where users can search for cities, see current weather, and keep a history of their searches. It's built with React, TypeScript, and follows clean coding principles."**

---

## How to Explain Your Project

### What does it do?
*"It's a weather app that shows current temperature, weather description, and wind speed for any city. Users can see their search history and click on previous searches to get weather again."*

### Why did you build it this way?
*"I wanted to practice modern React development with TypeScript and show I can write clean, testable code that's easy to maintain."*

---

## Technical Deep Dive

### Architecture Overview
*"The app follows a clean architecture with separate layers: components for UI, hooks for state management, services for API calls, and utilities for data transformation."*

### Key Technical Decisions
1. **TypeScript** - For type safety and better developer experience
2. **Custom Hooks** - For reusable state management logic
3. **Service Layer** - For API communication abstraction
4. **Component Composition** - For flexible, reusable UI components
5. **Local Storage** - For persistent search history

### Testing Strategy
*"I wrote 47 tests covering three areas: utility functions (21 tests), React hooks (13 tests), and component interactions (13 tests). All tests pass and provide good coverage."*

---

## SOLID Principles Implementation

### Single Responsibility
*"Each component and function has one job. SearchForm only handles search input, WeatherDisplay only shows weather data, and WeatherService only handles API calls."*

### Open/Closed
*"Components are extensible through props without modifying existing code. I can add new features by passing new props rather than changing the component internals."*

### Liskov Substitution
*"The weather service uses interfaces, so I can easily swap between different weather APIs (OpenWeather, WeatherAPI) without changing the rest of the code."*

### Interface Segregation
*"I use small, focused interfaces. SearchFormProps only has search-related props, WeatherDisplayProps only has display-related props."*

### Dependency Inversion
*"Components depend on abstractions (hooks, services) rather than concrete implementations. This makes the code more testable and flexible."*

---

## Common Interview Questions

### "Walk me through your code"
*"I'll start with the main App component that orchestrates everything, then show how the search form works, how weather data is displayed, and how search history is managed."*

### "What challenges did you face?"
*"The main challenge was implementing the undo functionality for search history. I solved it by storing the recently removed item and using a timeout to clear it after 5 seconds."*

### "How would you improve this?"
*"I'd add unit tests for edge cases, implement error boundaries, add more weather data like forecasts, and consider using a state management library for larger scale."*

### "What's your testing approach?"
*"I use a combination of unit tests for utility functions, integration tests for hooks, and component tests for user interactions. I focus on testing behavior rather than implementation details."*

## Demo Strategy

### 30-Second Demo Script
1. **Show the app running** - "Here's the weather app in action"
2. **Search for a city** - "I can search for any city and get current weather"
3. **Show weather display** - "It shows temperature, description, wind speed, and more"
4. **Demonstrate history** - "Search history is saved and clickable"
5. **Show undo feature** - "I can remove items and undo the removal"

### Key Features to Highlight
- **Search functionality** - Real-time validation, error handling
- **Weather display** - Comprehensive data, beautiful UI
- **Search history** - Persistent storage, clickable items
- **Undo functionality** - User-friendly error recovery
- **Responsive design** - Works on all devices

## Technical Questions to Expect

### React & TypeScript
- **"Why TypeScript?"** - Type safety, better IDE support, fewer runtime errors
- **"Custom hooks?"** - Reusable logic, separation of concerns, easier testing
- **"Component structure?"** - Functional components, props for data flow

### Testing
- **"Testing strategy?"** - Unit, integration, and component tests
- **"Test coverage?"** - 47 tests covering all critical functionality
- **"Testing tools?"** - Vitest, React Testing Library, user-event

### Architecture
- **"SOLID principles?"** - All 5 principles implemented throughout
- **"Error handling?"** - Try-catch blocks, user-friendly error messages
- **"Performance?"** - useCallback, memoization, efficient re-renders

## Final Tips

### Before the Interview
1. **Run the app** - Make sure everything works
2. **Review the code** - Be familiar with key files
3. **Practice the demo** - Know what to show and say
4. **Prepare questions** - Ask about their tech stack, team structure

### During the Interview
1. **Start simple** - Explain what the app does in plain English
2. **Show enthusiasm** - Be excited about what you built
3. **Be honest** - If you don't know something, say so
4. **Ask questions** - Show interest in their work
