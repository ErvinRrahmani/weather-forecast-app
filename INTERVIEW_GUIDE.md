# 🎯 Weather App - Interview Study Guide

*A simple guide to confidently explain your weather app project*

---

## 📋 Quick Project Summary

**"I built a weather app where users can search for cities, see current weather, and keep a history of their searches. It's built with React, TypeScript, and follows clean coding principles."**

---

## 🗣️ How to Explain Your Project

### **What does it do?**
*"It's a weather app that shows current temperature, weather description, and wind speed for any city. Users can see their search history and click on previous searches to get weather again."*

### **Why did you build it this way?**
*"I wanted to practice modern React development with TypeScript and show I can write clean, testable code that's easy to maintain."*

---

## 🏗️ Architecture (Keep it Simple!)

### **Main Parts:**
1. **Components** - The UI pieces (search box, weather display, history list)
2. **Hooks** - Logic for managing data (weather data, search history)
3. **Services** - Talks to the weather API
4. **Utils** - Helper functions (formatting, validation)

### **Data Flow:**
```
User types city → Search component → Hook fetches data → Service calls API → Display weather
```

---

## 💡 Key Technical Decisions

### **React + TypeScript**
- **Why React?** *"Popular, component-based, great ecosystem"*
- **Why TypeScript?** *"Catches errors early, better code documentation, easier refactoring"*

### **Custom Hooks**
- **What:** `useWeather`, `useSearchHistory`
- **Why:** *"Separates logic from UI, makes components cleaner, easier to test"*

### **Component Structure**
- **SearchForm** - Handles user input
- **WeatherDisplay** - Shows weather data
- **SearchHistory** - Shows previous searches
- **App** - Connects everything together

---

## 🧪 Testing (47 Tests!)

### **What you tested:**
- **Components:** User interactions (typing, clicking, form submission)
- **Hooks:** Data management (adding to history, localStorage)
- **Utils:** Helper functions (validation, formatting)

### **Why testing matters:**
*"Tests make sure the app works as expected and help catch bugs when I make changes."*

---

## 📱 Features You Can Demo

### **Core Features:**
1. **Search for weather** - Type any city name
2. **View results** - See temperature, description, wind speed
3. **Search history** - Previous searches are saved
4. **Click history** - Click any previous search to search again
5. **Remove from history** - Delete unwanted searches
6. **Undo remove** - Restore accidentally deleted items

### **Nice Touches:**
- Loading spinners while fetching data
- Error messages for invalid cities
- Responsive design (works on mobile)
- Saves history even after closing browser

## 🎤 Common Interview Questions & Answers

### **"Walk me through your code structure"**
*"I organized it into clear folders - components for UI, hooks for logic, services for API calls, and utils for helper functions. Each piece has one job and they work together cleanly."*

### **"How do you handle errors?"**
*"I use try-catch blocks around API calls, show user-friendly error messages, and have fallbacks for when things go wrong like network issues or invalid city names."*

### **"Why did you choose this tech stack?"**
*"React because it's widely used and component-based, TypeScript for better code quality and fewer bugs, and Tailwind CSS for quick, responsive styling."*

### **"How would you add new features?"**
*"The code is organized so new features are easy to add. For example, to add a 5-day forecast, I'd extend the weather service, update the data types, and create a new component to display it."*

### **"Tell me about your testing approach"**
*"I wrote tests for all the important parts - user interactions, data management, and utility functions. I focused on testing what users actually do rather than implementation details."*

### **"How do you ensure code quality?"**
*"I use TypeScript for type safety, write tests for important functionality, keep components small and focused, and organize code into clear, logical folders."*

## 🎯 Demo Script (30 seconds)

1. **"Let me show you the app running..."**
2. **Search:** "I'll search for London - see how it shows temperature, weather, and wind speed"
3. **History:** "Notice it saves my search here in the history"
4. **Click history:** "I can click Paris to search it again"
5. **Error handling:** "If I search for 'xyz123', it shows a helpful error message"
6. **Responsive:** "And it works great on mobile too"

---

## 🔧 If They Ask Technical Details

### **State Management:**
*"I used React hooks with localStorage for persistence. Custom hooks keep the logic separate from UI components."*

### **API Integration:**
*"I created a service class that handles all API calls, error mapping, and data transformation. It's easy to test and extend."*

### **Performance:**
*"I used useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders and structured the app to be efficient by default."*

### **Accessibility:**
*"I added ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and made sure it works with screen readers."*
